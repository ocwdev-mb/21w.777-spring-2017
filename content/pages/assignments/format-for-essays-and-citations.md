**Your Title** is not underlined, in quotes, or in italics; use boldface and initial capitals, as shown. Note: Do not use a separate sheet for a "title page".

**Number your pages**, by hand if necessary. Note: It is customary not to number the first page.

**Margins:** 1" top and bottom; 1 ¼" left and right.

**Double space** essays.

**Font:** Use type that is easy to read. I prefer either Times New Roman 12-point, or Optima 12-point.

**Paragraphs:** Indent paragraphs. Do not leave extra space between paragraphs unless you intend it to signify a transition.

A Note on Citation
------------------

We’ll use _Nature_ citation style or “magazine style” for all our essays. Nature style uses a superscript, like this{{< sup "1" >}}, coordinated with a list of References at the end. Magazine style doesn’t use references, but I would like a list of Sources at the end of your essays.

With either style, work important sources’ names into your text (not in parentheses!). Use signal phrases—for example: “As Elizabeth Kolbert remarks, ... ”; “According to Malcolm Gladwell, ... ” ; “While Michael Pollan claims \[whatever\] in his essay \[title\], ... “

**Modified _Nature_ reference style**

These are the key elements of _[Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/gta/index.html?foxtrotcallback=true#a5.4)_ style.

1.  References—in the listing that appears at the end of your essay—are each numbered, ordered sequentially as they appear in your text, tables, boxes, or figure captions.
2.  When cited in the text, reference numbers are superscript, not in brackets unless they are likely to be confused with a superscript number. Each source is assigned one number; each time you draw on that source, use the same superscript number, like this.{{< sup "1" >}}
3.  In addition–this is the modification–we are using signal phrases to introduce authors of quotes as well as anything where knowing the source will add to the validity and impact of the evidence. (According to Michael Pollan ...; “ ..., as reported in a recent issue of the _New York Times_.”)
    *   When you name an author or expert, you will probably want to identify her or him for readers, so that they will see the source’s credibility at a glance.
    *   When your source is a research study, and you are writing for the public, most of the time you’ll just want to name the journal where the study was published, and not include the names of the researchers.
    *   Similarly, when your source is a newspaper story, name the publication – _The New York Times_, _The Wall Street Journal_—and not Rudy Reporter, as the publication carries more weight. _Exception:_ Some journalists have national reputations and are worth naming. Examples include Michael Pollan, Malcolm Gladwell, Elizabeth Kolbert ... if you are in doubt, ask me.
4.  In your list of references:
    *   Authors should be listed surname first, followed by a comma and initials of given names.
    *   Titles of all cited articles are required. Titles of articles cited in reference lists should be in upright, not italic text; the first word of the title is capitalized, the title written exactly as it appears in the work cited, ending with a full stop.
    *   Book titles are italic with all main words capitalized.
    *   Journal titles are italic and abbreviated according to common usage. Volume numbers are bold. The publisher and city of publication are required for books cited. (Refer to published papers in _Nature_ for details.)
    *   References to web-only journals should give authors, article title and journal name as above, followed by URL in full—or DOI if known—and the year of publication in parentheses.
    *   References to websites should give authors if known, title of cited page, URL in full, and year of posting in parentheses.
