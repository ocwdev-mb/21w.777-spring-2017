**Revise Science in/and Culture Essay (Essay 1)** - Due with your Portfolio (or sooner)

Re-read all the comments you’ve received on your Science in/and Culture essay, from classmates & the instructor, and any notes you made.

Re-read your essay, with the notes in mind.

consider: To revise means literally (etymologically) to “re-see”—to take stock of your essay’s meaning and its possibilities, and to do what it takes to achieve meaning for yourself, and meaning and pleasure in reading for your audience. So aim to re-see your essay and its potential.

Think especially about shaping your essay, so that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
