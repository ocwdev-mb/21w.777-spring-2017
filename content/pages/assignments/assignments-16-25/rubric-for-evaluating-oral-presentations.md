Content
-------

**Structure**

*   Follows guidelines
*   Generates interest among listeners
*   Presents information in a sequence that’s easy to follow
*   Provides emphasis: what’s important? What’s especially interesting about this website?

**Clarity**

*   Points are clear: Clear thinking, clear sentences

Delivery
--------

**Vocal**

*   The speaker articulates clearly
*   S/he speaks fluently—i.e., without a lot of pauses and stumbles—and at a good pace—not too fast
*   Volume is appropriate for the space
*   Speaker avoids “like,” “you know,” “uh...,” etc. and also avoids upspeak—that is, the speaker doesn’t make statements sound like questions.

**Physical**

*   Speaker makes frequent eye contact with audience (whole audience and individuals, not just instructor)
*   Speaker’s posture is alert yet easy, i.e., not stiff
*   Speaker smiles and looks confident
*   Gestures aid clarity and emphasis and don’t seem random
*   Attire need not be formal, but it shouldn’t be so casual or sloppy that it distracts or detracts from the talk

What was the _best_ thing about the talk?

What would you recommend that the speaker work to _improve_ for next time?
